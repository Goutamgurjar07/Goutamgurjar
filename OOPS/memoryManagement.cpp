// memory management - memory management is a critical component of any programming language.
// It is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory for variables and datastructures.
// In C, memory management is manual, meaning that the programmer is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory using functions like

// types of memory in c++
// 1. stack memory : it is a region of memory that is used to store local variables and function parameters.
// 2. heap memory : it is a region of memory that is used to store dynamically allocated
// 3. static memory : it is a region of memory that is used to store global variables

// diffirece between stack and heap memory any five.
// 1. stack memory is faster than heap memory because it is allocated and deallocated quickly.
// 2. stack memory is more secure than heap memory because it is protected from memory leaks.
// 3. stack memory is more efficient than heap memory because it does not require garbage collection.
// 4. stack memory is more predictable than heap memory because itis allocated and deallocated in a predictable order.
// 5. stack memory is more portable than heap memory because it is not affected by the operating system.
// memory leak in c++

//heap memory
// 1. memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but fails to deallocate it.
// 2. memory leak can occur when a program uses a pointer to a dynamically allocated memory block without
//    deallocating it when it is no longer needed.
// 3. memory leak can occur when a program uses a pointer to a dynamically allocated memory block
//    without checking if the memory block has already been deallocated.
// 4. memory leak can occur when a program uses a pointer to a dynamically allocated memory block
//    without checking if the memory block has already been deallocated.
// 5. memory leak can occur when a program uses a pointer to a dynamically allocated memory block
//    without checking if the memory block has already been deallocated.
